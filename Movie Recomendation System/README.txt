Movie Recommendation System
Version: 1.0

A basic data science project implementing a movie recommendation algorithm based on user scoring.

This program was developed as a course assignment.

Link prediction algorithms based on network structure are widely used in information recommendation systems. The algorithm does not consider the content characteristics of users and products, and instead treats them as abstract nodes, constructing a bipartite graph based on the user's selection of products. It evaluates users' potential consumption trends by analyzing products they have never looked at.

MovieLens is one of the oldest recommendation systems. It was founded by the GroupLens project team at the School of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota, United States. MovieLens primarily uses Collaborative Filtering and Association Rules to recommend movies that users may be interested in.

Dataset used: MovieLens
Dataset file: ml-latest-small.zip â€” includes 700 users rating 100,000 reviews of 9,000 movies.
